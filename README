IMPORTANT: do not forget to run first "npm install" inside the root directory because the one I am sending does not
           include the "node_modules" directory.  Right after running the "npm install" command initially, the 
           "node_modules" directory gets populated and the entire dependencies and specifications of "package.json"
           gets installed.
